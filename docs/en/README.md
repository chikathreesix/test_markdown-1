# Basic writing and formatting syntax

## Headings

To create a heading, add one to six `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading.

```
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading
```

## Styling text

You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text.

## Quoting text

You can quote text with a `>`.

```
In the words of Abraham Lincoln:

> Pardon my French
```

## Quoting code

You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.

`Use git status to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.`

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

```
Some basic Git commands are:
\`\`\`
git status
git add
git commit
\`\`\`
```
